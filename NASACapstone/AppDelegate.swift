/**
 I tested this app with instruments on a physical device by clicking on "Show Debug Navigator" in the top left of Xcode. I clicked on "CPU", then "Profile in Instruments", then "Transfer" when prompted. I used the app and paused the instrument when I saw spikes in CPU usage. It helped to click on "Call Tree" at the bottom and check the boxes for "Hide System Libraries" and "Invert Call Tree".
 I did the same for RAM, pausing when memory increased dramatically, or when the Leaks timeline showed a problem. I would click "Mark Generation" before tapping on something to see how much memory was allocated for a specific action in the app. It helped to type the app name "NASACapstone" into the app to filter out memory unrelated to my code.
 Mainly, there was not much I could do to improve performance or memory usage because the app needed all of the resources it was using. I believe the memory continues to rise mainly because of Kingfisher caching images. Kingfisher is supposed to make sure caches don't go past their size limit. So mainly what I would do is change the cache size limit if I needed to.
